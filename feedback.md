## remarks
  - In usage please explain how to execute the script
  - create a data folder so you dont put data in utils and you don't mix csv and code
  - I see everyone used git but you only created and merged 1 branch, please try to create a branch by feature for the next projects so you avoid conflicts and you separate the tasks properly
  - Please delete remaining and useless branches when the project is finished to clean the repo
  - I don't have a clear view on who did what
  - no typing and no docstring :cry:
  - functions names format inconsistent (getTypeOfSale, get_property_data, save_property_data_2_csv)
  - No OOP logic, you did not separate the code in logical units and you did not create new class. clean_dataset.py does not have even a function
  - A few things to improve but the dataset is nice and the project is good :fire:
